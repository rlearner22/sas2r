<p>I am a statistical programmer who analyze clinical data using SAS software.Have been working
more than 12 years using SAS software , which is great tool to analyze the data and very easy
for Data manipulation . Recently I started exploring ways to analyze data available outside the
work environment, which is client specific. These are the things I ended up finding out</p>

<h2>How Can I use SAS software for personnel research</h2>
<p>There are couple of ways you can do</p>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download student version of SAS software. For this we need to have Student email ID, which I do not have it</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Second option is when I reading through the SAS-L found something about World programming</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Using WPS you can read and write SAS language programs exactly way you do it using SAS. I am using for my personnel purposes only as there was court litigation earlier in UK court and looks like WPS won the case . You can google more about it up</p>
