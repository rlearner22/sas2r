<h2>How Can I use SAS software for personnel research</h2>
<p>There are couple of ways you can do</p>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download student version of SAS software and set up an virtual environment ( this means that within your computer you will be creating a folder and make it virtual , that way you can’t install anything else in that folder) .</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>You need certain amount of research to install it . Once installed you have lot’s of limitations to access external data and number of rows ( There was limitation on number of rows to read)</p>
<p>I did not research further on this option.</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Second option I found on SAS-L discussion about World programming (Short name WPS)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Using WPS you can read and write SAS language programs exactly way you do it using SAS. I am using for my personnel purposes only as there was court litigation earlier in UK court and looks like WPS won the case . You can research more about it up</p>

<div id="clinical-data-to-download" class="section level2">
<h2>Clinical data to download</h2>
<p>Clinical data at <a href="https://data.projectdatasphere.org/projectdatasphere/html/home">Project Data Sphere</a></p>
<p>This home for lot’s clinical data sets (oncology) , This is the leading oncology data sharing platform . They host de-identified patient level data contributed by industry, academia and PDS research programs.</p>
<p>To access the data fist register for access ( usually takes about 3 to 7 days for approval) . Once you get access to the data , you see a page like this</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/data_source_page.JPG" alt="" />
<p class="caption">data location</p>
</div>
<p>navigate to access data. Once you reach there there are two ways of accessing data<br />
To right of the page there is SAS provides free access to Data in two different ways</p>
<p>– VDMML</p>
<p>VDMML has more tools ( Like SAS Viya , R link and other tools . ) This is little more complicated to set up ( I have not worked on it yet) .</p>
<p>– <a href="https://pdsprod.ondemand.sas.com/lsaf/">LSAF</a></p>
<p>LSAF is straight forward The way to log on is ,</p>
<p>When you click on the link it will ask for the user name is given to you on the PDS page and same password as that of Project sphere login</p>
<p>On the PDS screen you will see a screen like this</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">SAS logon</p>
</div>
<p>Once you log on to LSAF you see screen like this ,</p>
<p>[ Quick tip is once you login you may see a blank page send an email contact person and they are very quick in responding back ]</p>

</div>
<p>I had a zoom meeting with coordinators of this site , who told me that the data can be download to your drive and use for research work.</p>
<p>Only thing that we need to do to use the data is that we need to put them in reference section of the paper .</p>
<p>Downloaded data looks like this</p>
