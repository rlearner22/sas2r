<p>I am a statistical programmer who analyze clinical data using SAS software.Have been working
more than 12 years using SAS software , which is great tool to analyze the data and very easy
for Data manipulation . Recently I started exploring ways to analyze data available outside the
work environment, which is client specific. These are the things I ended up finding out</p>
<div id="how-can-i-use-sas-software-for-personnel-research" class="section level2">
<h2>How Can I use SAS software for personnel research</h2>
<p>There are couple of ways you can do</p>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download student version of SAS software. For this we need to have Student email ID, which I do not have it</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Second option is when I reading through the SAS-L found something about World programming</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Using WPS you can read and write SAS language programs exactly way you do it using SAS. I am using for my personnel purposes only as there was court litigation earlier in UK court and looks like WPS won the case . You can google more about it up</p>

<div id="clinical-data-to-download" class="section level2">
<h2>Clinical data to download</h2>
<p>Clinical data at <a href="https://www.projectdatasphere.org/">Project Data Sphere</a></p>
<p>This home for lot’s clinical data sets (oncology) , This is the leading oncology data
sharing platform . They host de-identified patient level data contributed by industry, academia and PDS research programs.</p>
<p>To access the data fist register for access ( usually takes about 3 to 7 days for approval) . Once you get access to the data , you see a page like this</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/data_source_page.JPG" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Login</p>
</div>
<p>Once you login to the page navigate to access data. Once you reach there there are two ways of accessing data<br />
To right of the page there is SAS provides free access to Data in two different ways</p>
<p>– VDMML
– LSAF</p>
<p>When you click on the link it will ask for the user name is given to you and same password as that of Project sphere login</p>
<p>VDMML has more tools ( Like SAS Viya , R studio and other tools . ) This is little more complicated to set up ( I have yet to figure it out ) .</p>
<p>LSAF is straight forward way when you login , you will see a screen like this</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>Once you login you see screen like this</p>

<p class="caption">datasourse</p>
</div>
<p>I had a zoom meeting with the people who are cordinators of this site , who told me that the data can be download to your drive and use for research work.</p>
<p>Only thing that we need to do to use the data is that we need to put them in reference section of the paper .</p>
<p>Downloaded data looks like this</p>
