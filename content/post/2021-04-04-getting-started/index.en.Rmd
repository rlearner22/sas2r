I am a statistical programmer who analyze clinical data using SAS software.Have been working 
more than 12 years using SAS software , which is great tool to analyze the data and very easy
for Data manipulation . Recently I started exploring ways to analyze data available outside the 
work environment, which is client specific. These are the things I ended up finding out 




## How Can I use SAS software for personnel research 
There are couple of ways you can do 




- 1. Download student version of SAS software. For this we need to have Student email ID, which I do not have it 




- 2. Second option is when I reading through the SAS-L found something about World programming 


Using WPS you can read and write SAS language programs exactly way you do it using SAS. I am using for my personnel purposes only  as there was court litigation earlier in UK court and looks like WPS won the case . You can google more about it up
